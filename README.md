# ash [WIP]
## pre-installation
Do not run the script as root/sudo! Only use sudo when the script itself prompts you to.

This script is intended for use on a fresh and minimal installation of Arch Linux, before the ```~/.config``` and ```~/Pictures``` directories are created.

Make sure you have dash installed to be able to run this.
```sh
sudo pacman -S dash
```
## installation
To download:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/1kping/ash ~/ash
```
To run the script:
```sh
~/ash/a.sh
```
