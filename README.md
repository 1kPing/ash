# ash
## pre-installation
Do not run the script as root/sudo! Only use sudo when the script itself prompts you to.

Make sure you have dash installed to be able to run this.
```sh
sudo pacman -S dash
```
Make sure that the ```ash``` directory is cloned under the ```~``` directory, or bad stuff might happen.
## installation
To run the script:
```sh
~/ash/a.sh
```
